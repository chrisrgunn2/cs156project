	support vector machine is a linear separator - it takes data that is already classified and tries to
	predict data that is not classified
	SVR  = Support Vector Regression
	SVR is a type of SVM that uses the space between data points as a margin of error and predicts
	the most likely next point in a data set
	SVM = Support Vector Machines - which are a type of ML model that can be used for classification and 
	Regression to predict novel data points within a graph
	'''

	'''
	kernel is a type of SVM, C = penalty parameter of the error returned. This value is scientific notation for 1000
	with SVM we want two things : 1.) a line that is closest between two points as possible (largest minimum margin,
	and 2.) a line that correctly separates as many instances as possible (two different classifications) but we
	can't always have both. the value for C determines how much we want the latter
	'No free lunch' there is no guarantee that one optimization will work better than the other so we need to try both
